# Weather App

This weather app is a project required in Oding Project. The idea is work around API's handling the cautions and particularities that they present.
The app was presents the following features:
  - The app gets the user location and shows the forecast for today and the following five days. 
  - User can search any city in order to see the current weather in that place (and the forecast of the following five days).
  - Background is set according to the different weather that might be presented (snow, rain, clear, cloudy, thunderstom).
  - Background is also set accordingly if it's night or day in the location (only if it rains or it's clear). 
  - User can set an unexistent location, although this is a UX bad practice, was made purpousely in order to practice the error handling
  when working with async functions and fetch.
